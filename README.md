#Here are some of the steps I took to implement this portfolio web page:
a) I used the <html lang ="en"> opening tag to specify the language of the entire document in English. 
b) I used semantic tags like <header>, <footer>, <main>, <em>, and <nav> in different sections of the project to indicate the meaning of each component of the web page's content.
c) The code contains comments in different places and CSS styling to make it look more colorful.
d) I used the <video> and the <audio> tags to insert video and audio files.
e) HTML <form> was also deployed in the project. I also mentioned in one of the comments that I made mistakes like using <forms> instead of <form>.
f) I used the unordered list <ul> and the ordered list <ol> in some sections of the document as well. 
g) The <footer> was styled using CSS to ensure that visitors are directed to my LinkedIn page. 
h) Local links were used (src) and an image (<img>) with alt text was deployed as well. 
i) The navigation <nav> bar/tag lists some menus. #
